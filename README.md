E-commerce Customer Behavior Analytics Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time data processing pipeline for analyzing customer behavior in an e-commerce platform. The system is built using Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, Snowflake, and Tableau to ingest, process, store, and visualize customer activity data, providing actionable insights for marketing and business teams.

Architecture
Apache Kafka: Captures customer activities such as clicks, product views, add-to-cart events, and purchases in real-time.
Spark Streaming: Consumes and processes data from Kafka, performing transformations to analyze customer behavior.
Snowflake: Stores the processed data for long-term analysis and querying.
Tableau: Visualizes the stored data to generate actionable business insights.

Features
Real-time data ingestion and processing.
Analysis of customer behavior (e.g., clicks, product views, purchases).
Scalability for handling large volumes of customer activity data.
Actionable insights generated using Tableau visualizations.
Seamless integration with Snowflake for data storage and analysis.
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: Real-time event streaming platform.
Apache Spark (PySpark): Streaming engine for data processing.
Snowflake: Cloud-based data warehouse for storing processed data.
Tableau: Data visualization tool to generate reports and dashboards.
Docker: Used for managing Kafka services.
Python: For Kafka producers and Spark Streaming consumers.

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

2. Kafka and Zookeeper Setup (Docker)
You'll need to set up Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker. The docker-compose.yml file is included in the repository.
docker-compose up -d

3. Create Kafka Topic
Create a Kafka topic named customer_activity to capture customer events.
kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic customer_activity

4. Kafka Producer
Run the Kafka producer to simulate customer events such as clicks, purchases, etc.
python kafka_producer.py

5. Spark Streaming Consumer
The Spark Streaming application consumes data from Kafka, processes it, and writes the results to Snowflake.

Submit the Spark job using the following command:
spark-submit \
  --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.1.2 \
  customer_activity_consumer.py

6. Snowflake Setup
Ensure that you have the necessary Snowflake table created and credentials set up for integration.

CREATE TABLE customer_behavior (
  event_type STRING,
  count INTEGER
);

7. Tableau Dashboard
Connect Tableau to the Snowflake database to visualize customer behavior analytics. You can generate insightful reports and dashboards based on the processed data

How It Works
Data Ingestion: The Kafka Producer simulates customer activities such as clicks, views, add-to-cart events, and purchases, publishing them to the customer_activity topic.
Data Processing: The Spark Streaming job consumes data from Kafka, performs transformations to aggregate and analyze customer behavior, and writes the output to Snowflake.
Data Storage: Processed data is stored in Snowflake for further analysis and querying.
Data Visualization: Tableau connects to Snowflake to visualize key metrics, enabling business users to make data-driven decisions.

Prerequisites
Docker for running Kafka and Zookeeper.
Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
Snowflake account for data storage.
Tableau for data visualization.
Python 3.x for writing producers and consumers.
